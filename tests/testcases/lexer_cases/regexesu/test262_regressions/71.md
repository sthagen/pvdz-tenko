## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?=.)**/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in five parsing modes: sloppy, sloppy+annexb, strict script, module, module+annexb.

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Regex A-ssertion "atoms" can not be quantified (so things like `^`, `$`, and `(?=` can not have `*`, `+`, `?`, or `{` following it) (by a `*`)

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?=.)**/u
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Sloppy mode with AnnexB

Parsed with script goal with AnnexB rules enabled and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Lexer error!
    Regex: Regex A-ssertion "atoms" can not be quantified (so things like `^`, `$`, and `(?=` can not have `*`, `+`, `?`, or `{` following it) (by a `*`); Encountered unescaped quantifier (ord=42) without a value to quantify

start@1:0, error@1:0
╔══╦════════════════
 1 ║ /(?=.)**/u
   ║ ^^^^^^^^^------- error
╚══╩════════════════

`````

### Module goal with AnnexB

Parsed with the module goal with AnnexB rules enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode with annexB._
